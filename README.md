# Predicting-House-Sale-Prices

 Wev work with housing data for the city of Ames, Iowa, United States from 2006 to 2010. Each row in the dataset describes the properties of a single house as well as the amount it was sold for
 
 Specifically, we'll explore the following questions:

- Which properties of a house most affect the final sale price?
- How effectively can we predict the sale price from just its properties?

Here are some of the columns:

- Lot Area: Lot size in square feet.
- Overall Qual: Rates the overall material and finish of the house.
- Overall Cond: Rates the overall condition of the house.
- Year Built: Original construction date.
- Low Qual Fin SF: Low quality finished square feet (all floors).
- Full Bath: Full bathrooms above grade.
- Fireplaces: Number of fireplaces.
